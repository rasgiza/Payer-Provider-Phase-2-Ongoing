# Healthcare Data Agent Guide

Complete reference for the **HealthcareHLSAgent** Fabric Data Agent -- setup, configuration, AI instructions, data sources, and customization.

---

## Overview

The HealthcareHLSAgent is a Copilot-powered Data Agent deployed into your Fabric workspace. It answers natural-language questions about healthcare analytics by querying a 13-table Gold-layer star schema via SQL and a companion semantic model via DAX.

**Two data sources are configured:**

| Source | Type | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| `lh_gold_curated` | Lakehouse tables (SQL) | Patient-level detail, multi-table JOINs, row-level filtering |
| `HealthcareDemoHLS` | Semantic model (DAX) | Pre-built measures, aggregations, time intelligence |

---

## Deployment

The agent is deployed automatically by the launcher notebook (Stage 5). It includes:

1. **Agent definition** -- `workspace/HealthcareHLSAgent.DataAgent/`
2. **AI instructions** -- system prompt controlling agent behavior
3. **Data source configs** -- lakehouse schema + semantic model with 26 DAX measures
4. **36 few-shot examples** -- pre-built SQL queries the agent uses as reference
5. **Knowledge documents** -- 21 markdown files uploaded to `lh_gold_curated/Files/healthcare_knowledge/`

After deployment, open the agent in your Fabric workspace and start asking questions. See [SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md](SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md) for 60+ ready-to-use prompts.

---

## AI Instructions (System Prompt)

The agent's system prompt is stored in `workspace/HealthcareHLSAgent.DataAgent/Files/Config/draft/stage_config.json` (and `published/`). Below is the full instruction set:

```
You are a Healthcare Intelligence Agent for a hospital analytics team. You answer
questions about readmissions, claim denials, medication adherence, prescriptions,
diagnoses, SDOH, and provider/payer analytics using a 13-table star schema in a
Gold-layer lakehouse.
```

### Concept-to-Table Routing

The agent uses these rules to select the correct table for each question:

| Concept | Table | Key Columns | Trigger Phrases |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Readmission risk (individual) | `fact_encounter` | readmission_risk_score (0.0-1.0), readmission_risk_category (High/Medium/Low), readmission_flag (0/1) | "risk score", "risk category", "high risk patients" |
| Readmission rates (aggregate) | `agg_readmission_by_date` | total_encounters, actual_readmissions, avg_risk_score | "readmission rate", "readmission trend", "monthly readmissions" |
| Claim denials | `fact_claim` | denial_flag (0/1), denial_risk_score, denial_risk_category, primary_denial_reason, claim_status, billed_amount, paid_amount | "denial", "denied", "denial rate", "denial reason" |
| Medication adherence | `agg_medication_adherence` JOIN `dim_medication` | pdc_score (0.0-1.0), adherence_category, gap_days, total_fills | "adherence", "PDC", "non-adherent", "gap days" |
| Prescriptions | `fact_prescription` JOIN `dim_medication` | total_cost, payer_paid, patient_copay, days_supply, fill_number | "prescription cost", "refill", "drug cost", "copay" |
| Diagnoses | `fact_diagnosis` JOIN `dim_diagnosis` | icd_code, icd_description, diagnosis_type | "diagnosis", "ICD", "condition", "chronic" |
| Encounters | `fact_encounter` | encounter_type, length_of_stay, total_charges, discharge_disposition | "length of stay", "encounter type", "charges" |
| Patient | `dim_patient` (filter `is_current = 1`) | patient_id, age, age_group, gender, zip_code, insurance_type | "patient details", "demographics" |
| Provider | `dim_provider` (filter `is_current = 1`) | display_name, specialty, department, npi_number | "provider", "doctor", "care manager" |
| SDOH | `dim_sdoh` JOIN `dim_patient` ON zip_code | poverty_rate, food_desert_flag, transportation_score, social_vulnerability_index | "social determinants", "poverty", "food desert" |
| Payer | `dim_payer` JOIN `fact_claim` ON payer_key | payer_name, payer_type | "payer", "insurance", "coverage" |

### Critical SQL Rules

1. **Never fabricate data** -- query first, then answer.
2. **ALWAYS filter `is_current = 1`** on `dim_patient` and `dim_provider` (SCD Type 2).
3. For rates/percentages, show numerator AND denominator. Use `NULLIF` to prevent divide-by-zero.
4. **Never AVG a pre-computed rate column** -- recalculate `SUM(numerator)/SUM(denominator)`.
5. `agg_` tables have **NO `provider_key`**. Use fact tables for provider-level analysis.
6. When asked for a "breakdown" or "distribution", `GROUP BY` the category column and `COUNT(*)`.
7. "care manager" / "attending physician" / "provider" all mean `dim_provider`.
8. Default to `TOP 20` for large unbounded result sets.
9. **Never add date filters** unless the user explicitly specifies a time period.
10. For ALL denial analysis, use `fact_claim`. Join `dim_payer` ON `payer_key` for payer breakdowns.
11. Join dimensions on surrogate keys EXCEPT `dim_sdoh` which joins on `zip_code`.

### Industry Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Readmission rate | < 15% | CMS HRRP |
| Denial rate | < 8% | HFMA |
| PDC adherent | >= 80% | CMS Star |
| Avg LOS (inpatient) | 4-6 days | AHA |
| Avg LOS (observation) | 1-2 days | AHA |

### Response Format

1. Direct answer with metric
2. Breakdown or details
3. Context vs benchmarks
4. Recommendation (when relevant)
5. 2-3 follow-up questions

## Customizing the Agent

### Modify AI Instructions

Edit `stage_config.json` in both `draft/` and `published/` directories:

```
workspace/HealthcareHLSAgent.DataAgent/Files/Config/draft/stage_config.json
workspace/HealthcareHLSAgent.DataAgent/Files/Config/published/stage_config.json
```

The `aiInstructions` field contains the full system prompt. Changes take effect after redeploying the agent.

### Add Few-Shot Examples

Edit `fewshots.json` in the lakehouse data source directory. Each example needs:

```json
{
  "id": "<unique-guid>",
  "question": "Natural language question",
  "query": "SQL query that answers the question"
}
```

### Add Knowledge Documents

Place new `.md` files in the `healthcare_knowledge/` directory (organized by subdirectory). The launcher uploads them to `lh_gold_curated/Files/healthcare_knowledge/` during deployment. To add docs after deployment, upload manually via the Fabric portal to the lakehouse Files section.

### Update Data Source Instructions

Edit `datasource.json` in the lakehouse data source directory to update table schemas, SQL rules, or reference values:

```
workspace/HealthcareHLSAgent.DataAgent/Files/Config/draft/lakehouse-tables-lh_gold_curated/datasource.json
```

        (same structure as draft/)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agent returns generic/wrong answers | Check that Gold lakehouse tables are populated (run the pipeline first) |
| Agent doesn't use knowledge docs | Verify docs exist in `lh_gold_curated/Files/healthcare_knowledge/` |
| Agent queries wrong table | Review concept-to-table routing in `stage_config.json` |
| Agent fabricates data | The system prompt says "never fabricate" -- ensure it's not overridden |
| Agent can't find patients | Ensure `is_current = 1` filter is applied (SCD2 dimension) |
| Few-shot examples not working | Check `fewshots.json` -- each entry needs a unique `id`, `question`, and `query` |
| Semantic model measures unavailable | Ensure the semantic model is refreshed after pipeline run |
