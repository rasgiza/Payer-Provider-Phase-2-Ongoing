## Why This Demo? — The Payer & Provider Pain Points

Healthcare payers and providers face compounding operational challenges that erode revenue, increase regulatory risk, and compromise patient outcomes. This demo addresses **six critical pain points** that cost the U.S. healthcare system billions annually:

### 1. Claim Denials Are Draining Revenue

> **Industry average denial rate: 10-15%** — costing a mid-size health system **$4.2M+ per year** in rework, appeals, and lost revenue.

Payers deny claims for preventable reasons: missing documentation (23%), invalid codes (18%), eligibility issues (14%), and prior authorization gaps. Most organizations lack real-time visibility into *which* claims are at risk *before* submission. This demo builds a **denial risk scoring model** that flags high-risk claims proactively, surfaces root causes by payer, and tracks appeal success rates — turning reactive denial management into a predictive workflow.

### 2. Readmissions Drive CMS Penalties

> **CMS Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP)** penalizes hospitals **up to 3% of total Medicare reimbursement** — for a $450M system, that's **$13.5M at stake**.

30-day readmissions for CHF, COPD, pneumonia, AMI, and TKA/THA are tracked and penalized. Yet most providers lack integrated risk scoring that combines clinical data with social determinants. This demo computes **readmission risk scores** using encounter history, diagnosis complexity, and SDOH factors (food deserts, housing instability, transportation barriers), enabling targeted discharge planning before patients leave the facility.

### 3. Medication Non-Adherence Sinks Star Ratings

> **CMS Star Ratings** triple-weight medication adherence measures (diabetes, RAS antagonists, statins) — making PDC scores the **single largest driver** of plan quality ratings and bonus payments.

Plans with 4+ stars receive significant CMS bonus payments, but adherence gaps are invisible without pharmacy claims integration. This demo calculates **Proportion of Days Covered (PDC)** per patient per drug class, identifies non-adherent members with chronic conditions, and maps adherence gaps to HEDIS measures — giving care managers actionable intervention lists.

### 4. Social Determinants Are Invisible in Clinical Workflows

> **80% of health outcomes** are driven by factors outside the clinic — yet SDOH data rarely appears alongside clinical data.

Zip-code-level poverty rates, food desert flags, transportation scores, housing instability rates, and social vulnerability indices exist in public datasets but aren't integrated into analytics platforms. This demo joins **SDOH data at the zip-code level** to every patient, encounter, and claim — enabling population health stratification, SDOH-informed readmission prevention, and health equity reporting.

### 5. Provider-Payer Contract Complexity Creates Revenue Leakage

> Health systems manage **12+ payer contracts** with different reimbursement rates, PA requirements, timely filing deadlines, and denial behaviors.

Without contract-level analytics, systems can't identify which payers underpay, which deny most frequently, or where network adequacy gaps exist. This demo models **payer-specific analytics** across 12 simulated payers with realistic contract rates, denial patterns, and formulary coverage — revealing collection rate variance and contract negotiation priorities.

### 6. Analytics Teams Can't Stand Up Environments Fast Enough

> Traditional healthcare analytics projects take **weeks to provision** — installing Python, configuring credentials, deploying infrastructure, debugging authentication.

This demo eliminates the entire setup burden. **One notebook, one click, fifteen minutes.** SQL-only analysts, clinical informaticists, and business users can explore a fully functional environment without touching a command line.

### What This Demo Proves

By combining all six dimensions — **claims + readmissions + adherence + SDOH + provider network + quality measures** — in a single Fabric workspace, this demo shows how Microsoft Fabric's unified platform (OneLake, Spark, Direct Lake, Copilot AI) can deliver:

- **Real-time denial risk dashboards** with root cause analysis and appeal tracking
- **Predictive readmission scoring** with SDOH-informed discharge planning
- **HEDIS-aligned medication adherence** monitoring with care gap closure
- **Natural language analytics** via Fabric Data Agent and Azure AI Foundry
- **Ontology-driven knowledge graphs** connecting patients → encounters → claims → providers → payers

All from a single workspace deployed in minutes.

## Phase 2 — Persona Coverage (CMO / CFO / COO / CTO)

Phase 2 hardens the Real-Time Intelligence stack to close the operational
"right-now" pain points for four executive personas without duplicating Power BI
(strategic / historical) work.

**Lane separation rule (anti-duplication with Power BI):**
> If the answer doesn't change in ≥1 hour → **Power BI** (strategic).
> If it changes in seconds-to-minutes → **RTI Dashboard** (operational).

### What Phase 2 adds

| Layer | New artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Eventhouse** | 8 new typed tables, 4 utility tables, 50+ new columns on `rti_all_events`, retention/caching/mirroring policies, `dashboard_thresholds` config | Production hardening + persona event coverage |
| **Simulator** | 8 new event generators (15 event types total per batch) | Drives all CMO/CFO/COO/CTO tiles |
| **Notebooks** | `NB_RTI_Provider_Alerts`, `NB_RTI_Payer_Alerts`, `NB_RTI_COO_Alerts`, `NB_RTI_CTO_Alerts`, `NB_RTI_Alert_Closure` | Generate persona alerts → Delta + KQL; track MTTR |
| **Dashboard guide** | [`rti_dashboard/TILE_QUERY_PACK.md`](rti_dashboard/TILE_QUERY_PACK.md) | ~30 copy-paste KQL tiles across 6 persona pages |

### Persona questions answered in real-time

#### CMO — Chief Medical Officer
Real-time clinical operations and quality:
1. Which patients on the floor right now are deteriorating (NEWS2 ≥ 5, SIRS ≥ 2)?
2. Are we seeing an HAI cluster forming on any ward in the last 72 hours?
3. Which providers' quality metrics drifted in the last shift?
4. Who was just readmitted within 30 days and what's the severity?
5. Which patients are at high readmission risk *and* non-adherent to medications right now?
6. What's our open-alert backlog by severity for clinical operations?

#### CFO — Chief Financial Officer
Real-time revenue protection and contract performance:
1. What's our net revenue variance vs expected payment by contract type in the last 24h?
2. Which underpayments crossed the −5% threshold in the last 6 hours?
3. Which providers have the highest fraud scores right now and what's the dollar exposure?
4. Which members are on accelerating cost trajectories?
5. What's the open-alert backlog for revenue-cycle alerts?
6. What's our care-gap closure volume today by gap type?

#### COO — Chief Operating Officer

1. What's the current ED boarding count vs threshold by facility?
2. Which units are at ≥95% bed occupancy right now?
3. Where is OR turnover time exceeding 60 minutes?
4. Which wards have a staffing gap (nurse-to-acuity below target) right now?
5. Who has been admitted longer than 7 days?
6. What's the open-alert backlog for operations?

#### CTO — Chief Technology Officer / Platform & Security
Real-time platform health and trust:
1. Which DQ rules are breaching threshold right now and on which source tables?
2. What's the current ingestion lag (p50 / p90 / p99) by event type?
3. Are there PHI access anomalies (geo / action / score) in the last hour?
4. Which production models are drifting (PSI ≥ 0.1)?
5. What's the open-alert backlog for platform health?

> **Cross-persona view:** A 6th dashboard page combines all open alerts + MTTR
> heatmap (persona × alert_type) + SLA burn-down trend, with closures fed back
> by Power Automate via the receiver pattern in `NB_RTI_Alert_Closure`.

See [`rti_dashboard/TILE_QUERY_PACK.md`](rti_dashboard/TILE_QUERY_PACK.md) for
the copy-paste KQL behind every tile and the re-export workflow.

## Quick Start

1. **Create an empty Fabric workspace** (F64+ capacity recommended)
2. **Import** `Healthcare_Launcher.ipynb` into the workspace  
   *(Workspace → Import → Notebook → upload the .ipynb file)*
3. **Run All** — wait ~15-20 minutes

> **That's it — no configuration needed.** The notebook pulls from the public repo `rasgiza/Fabric-Payer-Provider-HealthCare-Demo` by default. If you want to change settings, edit the CONFIG cell before running — for example, set `DEPLOY_STREAMING = True` to enable Real-Time Intelligence (Eventhouse + KQL + scoring), or point `GITHUB_OWNER` to your own fork.
>
> **First deployment** deploys ETL + Agents (Cells 1-11). Set `DEPLOY_STREAMING = True` for the full RTI stack (Cells 12-13).

The launcher creates a deploy lakehouse, downloads the repo, deploys all artifacts in the correct stage order, generates sample data, runs the ETL pipeline, creates the semantic model, deploys the ontology + graph, and patches Data/Graph Agents — fully automated. RTI is opt-in via `DEPLOY_STREAMING = True`.

| **14** | Organize workspace folders + print deployment summary |

> ⚡ = Only runs when `DEPLOY_STREAMING = True`

> **No manual lakehouse creation required.** Unlike manual deployment approaches that require creating a `deploy_staging` lakehouse and uploading folders, `fabric-launcher` handles repo download, extraction, and artifact reading automatically using the notebook's built-in default lakehouse.

### Deployment Stages (Cell 3)

| Stage | Item Types | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Lakehouse (4) | Always — notebooks reference lakehouses via `logicalId` |
| 2 | Eventhouse | `DEPLOY_STREAMING` only — async provisioning |
| 3 | KQLDatabase | `DEPLOY_STREAMING` only — needs Eventhouse ready |
| 4-5 | Notebook (create + updateDefinition) | Always — pipelines reference notebooks |
| 6 | DataPipeline (2) | Always — orchestrate notebook execution |
| 7 | DataAgent | Always — Data Agent (SM wired in Cell 8) |
| 8 | OperationsAgent | `DEPLOY_STREAMING` only — needs KQL DB |

## After Deployment

### Explore the Data
- Open **lh_gold_curated** → Tables → you'll see star schema tables (fact_encounters, dim_patients, etc.)
- Open **HealthcareDemoHLS** semantic model → create Power BI reports

### Sample Questions — Data Agents

The solution includes two complementary AI agents:

- **HealthcareHLSAgent** — SQL-based agent for aggregations, rates, and trends ("What is the denial rate?", "Top 10 providers by cost")
- **Healthcare Ontology Agent** — Graph traversal agent for entity lookups and relationships ("Tell me about patient PAT0000001", "Who treated this patient?", "Trace claim CLM0009999 from patient to payer")

See **[SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md](SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md)** for 80+ copy-paste questions organized by domain and agent.

### Data Agent Reference

For the complete agent configuration -- AI instructions, concept-to-table routing, SQL rules, few-shot examples, knowledge base, and customization guide -- see **[DATA_AGENT_GUIDE.md](DATA_AGENT_GUIDE.md)**.

### Power BI Dashboard

The **Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** Power BI report is auto-deployed by fabric-cicd from the `workspace/Healthcare Analytics Dashboard.Report/` definition. It includes:

| Page | Focus | Key Visuals |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Executive Summary | KPIs, denial rates, encounter volume | Card KPIs, trend lines, donut charts |
| Claim Denials | Root cause, payer breakdown, financial impact | Waterfall, stacked bar, matrix |
| Readmission Risk | 30-day readmission by facility & diagnosis | Heatmap, scatter, decomposition tree |
| Medication Adherence | PDC rates, non-adherent populations | Gauge, grouped bar, line chart |
| Social Determinants | SDOH risk by zip code, demographics | Map, bar, correlation scatter |
| Provider Performance | Provider metrics, outlier detection | Table, bullet chart, ranking |

The report binds to the `HealthcareDemoHLS` semantic model via Direct Lake (live connection). It starts working as soon as the semantic model refresh completes (Cell 8).

For customization guidance (26 DAX measures, formatting tips, Direct Lake best practices) -- see **[POWERBI_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md](POWERBI_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md)**.

### Azure AI Foundry (Optional)

To set up the **Foundry Orchestrator Agent** that combines the Fabric Data Agent with a Knowledge Base (21 clinical documents indexed via Azure AI Search) and web search for hybrid clinical decision support -- see **[FOUNDRY_IQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md](FOUNDRY_IQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**.

For troubleshooting hybrid query failures (compound questions, instruction truncation, fewshot phrasing issues) -- see **[FOUNDRY_ORCHESTRATOR_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](FOUNDRY_ORCHESTRATOR_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**.

## Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) — 3 Payer/Provider Use Cases

When `DEPLOY_STREAMING=True`, the launcher deploys a full RTI stack: **Eventhouse + KQL Database + 3 scoring notebooks + OpsAgent + RTI Dashboard** that address high-value payer/provider pain points where batch analytics fall short.

> **Demo hardening (Phase 2.1)**: see [`DEMO_SCENARIOS.md`](DEMO_SCENARIOS.md)
> for the four seeded stories (Maria Lopez readmit, Dr. Raj Singh fraud spike,
> John Patient cross-stream, Beaumont Royal Oak capacity). Run
> `NB_RTI_Seed_Scenarios` after the simulator is streaming, then visit the new
> **Triage & Performance** page in `Healthcare_RTI_Dashboard` for the
> cross-stream / provider-scorecard / MTTD-MTTR tiles. The dashboard's MTTR
> stat is fed by `alert_closure_events`, which is populated by the
> **Acknowledge** action in the `Healthcare_RTI_NotifyCareTeam` Power Automate
> adaptive card — this closes the loop from alert → notify → ack → measurable
> response.

### Use Case 1: Claims Fraud Detection

> **$68B lost to healthcare fraud annually** (NHCAA). Most SIU teams investigate claims weeks after submission — by then, the money is gone.

**NB_RTI_Fraud_Detection** scores every claim in real-time using 4 rule-based signals:
- **Velocity burst** — Provider submits many claims within a 1-hour window (30 pts max)
- **Amount outlier** — Claim exceeds 3σ of provider's historical mean (25 pts max)
- **Geographic anomaly** — Patient location far from provider facility (25 pts max)
- **Upcoding** — Consistent use of highest E&M code 99215 (20 pts max)

Risk tiers: **CRITICAL** (≥50) → **HIGH** (≥30) → **MEDIUM** (≥15) → **LOW**

**Output:** `rti_fraud_scores` with lat/long for map visuals showing fraud hotspots.

### Use Case 2: Care Gap Closure at Point of Care

> **Payers spend $2-4 per member per month** on outreach for HEDIS gaps. The highest-value moment is when the patient is *already in front of a provider* — but the care team doesn't know about open gaps.

**NB_RTI_Care_Gap_Alerts** fires when an ADT (Admit/Discharge/Transfer) event arrives:
1. Joins the encounter with the patient's **8 HEDIS measures** (CDC, COL, BCS, SPC, CBP, SPD, OMW, PPC)
2. Checks for open care gaps and ranks by priority (CRITICAL if diabetes/cancer gap >180 days)
3. Generates **human-readable alerts** for the care team at the bedside

**Output:** `rti_care_gap_alerts` with facility lat/long for map visuals showing which facilities have the most gap closure opportunities.

### Use Case 3: High-Cost Member Trajectory

> **5% of members drive 50% of total healthcare costs.** Early identification of members *trending toward* high-cost status enables care management intervention before catastrophic events.

**NB_RTI_HighCost_Trajectory** computes rolling windows over claims and encounters:
- **30-day and 90-day rolling spend** — flags members exceeding $15K/30d or $40K/90d
- **ED superutilizer detection** — ≥3 emergency visits in 30 days
- **Readmission tracking** — multiple admits within 30 days
- **Cost trend** — ACCELERATING / RISING / STABLE / DECLINING

Risk tiers: **CRITICAL** (high spend + frequent ED) → **HIGH** (high spend) → **MEDIUM** (ED/readmit/accelerating) → **LOW**

**Output:** `rti_highcost_alerts` with lat/long for map visuals showing cost hotspots.

### RTI Data Tables

| Table | Description | Rows (Default) |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `rti_claims_events` | Simulated claim submissions with fraud patterns | ~500 |
| `rti_adt_events` | ADT events (admit/discharge/transfer) | ~250 |
| `rti_rx_events` | Prescription fill events | ~166 |
| `rti_fraud_scores` | Scored claims with risk tiers and fraud flags | ~500 |
| `rti_care_gap_alerts` | Point-of-care gap closure alerts | varies |
| `rti_highcost_alerts` | Members on escalating cost trajectory | varies |

### RTI Ingestion Architecture

**Eventstream is the front door for all streaming data.** Cell 12 of `Healthcare_Launcher` wires the full Eventstream topology via API. The user copies the connection string from the portal and pastes it into the simulator notebook — then events stream continuously through the entire pipeline.

```
NB_RTI_Event_Simulator
    │
    ▼
Healthcare_RTI_Eventstream (Custom Endpoint — EventHub protocol)
    │
    ├──► Eventhouse / KQL DB          (real-time hot path: dashboards, scoring, Operations Agent)
    └──► Activator / Reflex           (fraud/care-gap/high-cost alerts)
```

**Lakehouse** (`lh_gold_curated`) serves as the **batch archive** — populated by the medallion ETL pipeline, not by streaming. The KQL Eventhouse is the real-time query engine; the Lakehouse gold layer is the historical analytics engine. Each serves its optimal workload.

#### Best Practice vs Demo Approach

| Aspect | Production Best Practice | This Demo |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Unified access** | Enable OneLake Availability on KQL DB → create OneLake shortcuts in Lakehouse pointing to KQL tables → query both stores via one semantic model | KQL Eventhouse for real-time; Lakehouse for batch — queried separately |
| **Why the difference** | OneLake shortcuts require manual "Enable OneLake Availability" in the portal, propagation delays (30-60s), and specific table format requirements that don't lend themselves to one-click automation | Demo prioritizes reliability and zero manual portal steps over unified access |
| **Trade-off** | Unified lakehouse view of both batch + streaming tables | Two query surfaces: KQL for streaming, Spark SQL for batch — both are fully functional |

> **To enable shortcuts in your own environment (recommended for production):**
> 1. Open your **KQL Database** in the Fabric portal
> 2. Click **Database details** → toggle **OneLake availability** to **Active**
> 3. Wait ~60 seconds for propagation
> 4. In your Lakehouse → **New shortcut** → **Microsoft OneLake** → select the KQL database → choose tables
> 5. Streaming tables now appear as Delta tables in the Lakehouse alongside batch gold tables

**How to start streaming (1 manual step):**

1. Cell 12 of `Healthcare_Launcher` wires the Eventstream topology and prints the URL
2. Open **Healthcare_RTI_Eventstream** in the Fabric portal
3. Click the **HealthcareCustomEndpoint** source node → copy the **Connection String**
4. Open **NB_RTI_Event_Simulator** → paste into `ES_CONNECTION_STRING`
5. Run the notebook → events stream continuously every 5 seconds
6. Then run the scoring notebooks: `NB_RTI_Fraud_Detection`, `NB_RTI_Care_Gap_Alerts`, `NB_RTI_HighCost_Trajectory`

> The user can re-run the simulator and scoring notebooks anytime to generate and process fresh data.

#### API vs Portal Capabilities

| Action | API | Portal |
|---|---|---|
| Create Eventstream item | ✅ Done by Cell 12 | ✅ |
| Add Custom Endpoint source | ✅ Done by Cell 12 (definition API) | ✅ |
| Wire Eventhouse destination | ✅ Done by Cell 12 (definition API) | ✅ |
| Wire Lakehouse destination | ✅ Done by Cell 12 (if lh_bronze_raw exists) | ✅ |
| Wire Activator/Reflex destination | ✅ Done by Cell 12 (if Reflex item exists) | ✅ |
| Configure stream routing | ✅ Done by Cell 12 (definition API) | ✅ |
| **Get connection string** | ❌ Not exposed in API schema | ✅ Portal only |
| Verify topology status | ✅ GET /topology endpoint | ✅ |

### Use Case 4 — Operations Agent (HealthcareOpsAgent)

> **Status: Deployed automatically** by Cell 12 of `Healthcare_Launcher` (requires `DEPLOY_STREAMING=True`). The agent is created via the dedicated `/operationsAgents` REST API and configured with goals, instructions, and a KQL data source pointing to `Healthcare_RTI_DB`.

The Operations Agent is an AI-powered operational intelligence layer that sits on top of the three RTI scoring outputs and unifies monitoring, triage, and action into a single interface.

| Module | Capability | Integration |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Unified Alert Triage** | Merges fraud + care gap + high-cost alerts into a single priority-ranked worklist, deduplicates by patient across alert types | KQL queries against Eventhouse |
| **SLA & Throughput Monitoring** | Tracks data freshness per input table, pipeline completion SLA, alert-to-action latency | Fabric REST API + KQL |
| **Automated Action Routing** | CRITICAL fraud → SIU queue, CRITICAL care gaps → provider EHR/fax, CRITICAL high-cost → care management referral | Power Automate flows |
| **Natural Language Ops** | Ops teams query alerts conversationally: "What are today's top 10 priorities?" | Fabric OperationsAgent with KQL tools |

**Sample Operations Agent questions:**

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 38 | What are today's top 10 priorities across all alert types? |
| 39 | Which facilities have the most CRITICAL alerts right now? |
| 40 | Is the claims pipeline running on time? When was the last event ingested? |
| 41 | Show me patients who triggered both fraud and high-cost alerts simultaneously. |
| 42 | How many CRITICAL alerts are unresolved from the last 24 hours? |
| 43 | What is the average time between event ingestion and alert generation? |

#### Post-Deployment Setup (Manual — ~10 min)

After `Healthcare_Launcher` completes, the Operations Agent is created with goals, instructions, and KQL data source but needs **two manual steps** before it's fully operational:

**Step 1: Add a Power Automate Action (Email Alerts)**

1. Open **HealthcareOpsAgent** in the Fabric workspace
2. Go to the **Actions** tab → **+ Add action** → **Custom action**
3. **Workspace:** select your workspace (e.g., `healthcare-project-demo`)
4. **Activator:** select the activator item (e.g., `Test21`)
5. Wait for "Activator created successfully" ✅
6. Copy the **connection string** shown on screen
7. Click **Open flow builder** — this opens Power Automate
8. In Power Automate, click the **"When an activator rule is triggered"** trigger card → paste the connection string to fix "Invalid parameters"
9. Click **+ (Add an action)** below the trigger
10. Search for **"Office 365 Outlook"** → select **"Send an email (V2)"**
11. Configure the email:
    - **To:** your team distribution list or individual email
    - **Subject:** `Healthcare Alert: @{triggerBody()?['alertType']} - @{triggerBody()?['riskTier']}`
    - **Body:** Use dynamic content from the trigger to include alert details
12. Optionally add **"Respond to the agent"** (under AI capabilities) as a second action so the agent gets confirmation
13. **Save** the flow → return to the Fabric tab → click **Apply**

**Step 2: Activate the Agent**

1. In the **HealthcareOpsAgent** overview, toggle the agent to **Active**
2. Or via API: update the definition with `"shouldRun": true`

> **Note:** The agent monitors 6 KQL tables (claims_events, adt_events, rx_events, fraud_scores, care_gap_alerts, highcost_alerts). Make sure RTI pipelines have run at least once so the tables contain data.

### Data Agents

The **HealthcareHLSAgent** (SQL agent) is deployed programmatically by the launcher — no manual setup required. It connects to the `HealthcareDemoHLS` semantic model and includes AI instructions and data source configuration automatically.

To test it, open the agent in your workspace and try a sample question:
- *"What is the overall denial rate by payer?"*
- *"Show me the top 10 providers by total billed amount"*
- *"Which patients have the highest readmission risk?"*

See **[SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md](SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md)** for 80+ tested questions across all domains.

#### Data Agent — Ontology As Source

The **HealthcareHLSOntology Agent** (graph agent) must be created manually in the Fabric UI — it cannot be fully deployed via API.

**Step 1: Create the Agent**

1. In your workspace → **+ New item** → **Data agent**

   ![Data agent card](docs/images/agent-new-item.png)

2. Name it `HealthcareHLSOntology Agent` → click **Create**

   ![Create data agent dialog](docs/images/agent-create-dialog.png)

**Step 2: Add the Data Source**

1. Click **Add Data** → **Data source**

   ![Add Data dropdown](docs/images/agent-add-data-source.png)

2. Browse to your workspace → select the ontology **`Healthcare_Demo_Ontology_HLS`** (Graph model)

   ![Select ontology graph](docs/images/agent-select-ontology.png)

3. The agent will connect to the graph model (12 entities, 18 relationships)

**Step 3: Configure AI Instructions**

1. Click **Agent instructions** (top toolbar)

   ![Agent instructions panel](docs/images/agent-instructions.png)

2. Copy the AI instructions text from **[DATA_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md → Section 2a](DATA_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md#2-healthcare-ontology-agent-graph-agent)** — AI Instructions
3. Paste into the instructions text box → click **Apply**

> These instructions tell the agent about the ontology entities, relationships, and graph traversal patterns for healthcare queries.

**Step 4: Test the Agent**

1. In the agent chat panel, try a sample question:
   - *"Which providers treat patients covered by Aetna?"*
   - *"Show the care pathway for patient P-1001"*
   - *"What prescriptions are linked to claims denied for medical necessity?"*
2. See **[SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md → Graph Agent](SAMPLE_QUESTIONS.md#graph-agent-healthcare-ontology-agent)** section for more questions

### Set Up Data Activator Alerts (Manual — ~15 min)

Data Activator (Reflex) is the **production-grade alerting layer** for this solution. It monitors RTI KQL tables in real time and fires **proactive alerts** via Email, Teams, or Power Automate when scoring thresholds are breached — no code required.

> **Why Activator?** In real-world healthcare operations, compliance and audit teams need **deterministic, rule-based alerts** that fire consistently and can be traced back to exact thresholds. Activator provides this with built-in deduplication, configurable cadence, and direct integration with Teams/Email/Power Automate — making it the operational backbone for:
> - **Fraud SIU teams** receiving immediate referrals when anomaly scores spike
> - **Care coordinators** getting notified of overdue HEDIS gaps when patients are admitted
> - **Case managers** flagged on high-cost member trajectories before costs escalate
> - **IT/ops teams** alerted to pipeline staleness or data quality issues

#### Step 1: Create a Reflex Item

1. In your Fabric workspace → **+ New item** → **Reflex**
2. Name it `Healthcare_RTI_Alerts`

#### Step 2: Connect to the KQL Database

1. In the Reflex item → **Get data** → **KQL Database**
2. Select `Healthcare_RTI_DB` (in the `Healthcare_RTI_Eventhouse`)
3. You'll add triggers for each of the 3 scoring tables below

#### Step 3: Configure Alert Rules

**Rule 1 — Fraud Detection (SIU Referral)**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Table** | `fraud_scores` |
| **Monitor** | `fraud_score` |
| **Condition** | `fraud_score >= 50` |
| **Action 1** | **Email** → notify SIU team |
| **Action 2** | **Teams** → post to `#fraud-investigations` channel (optional) |
| **Card fields** | claim_id, patient_id, provider_id, fraud_score, fraud_flags, risk_tier |
| **Email Subject** | `🚨 CRITICAL Fraud Alert — SIU Referral: Patient {{patient_id}}` |
| **Email Body** | `Claim {{claim_id}}, Score {{fraud_score}}, Flags: {{fraud_flags}}` |

**Rule 2 — Care Gap Outreach (Overdue HEDIS Gaps)**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Table** | `care_gap_alerts` |
| **Monitor** | `gap_days_overdue` |
| **Condition** | `gap_days_overdue > 90` |
| **Action 1** | **Email** → notify care coordinator |
| **Action 2** | **Teams** → post to `#care-coordination` channel (optional) |
| **Card fields** | patient_id, measure_name, gap_days_overdue, alert_priority, alert_text |
| **Email Subject** | `⚠️ Care Gap Alert — {{measure_name}}: Patient {{patient_id}}` |
| **Email Body** | `{{gap_days_overdue}} days overdue, Priority: {{alert_priority}}` |

**Rule 3 — High-Cost Member (Care Management Referral)**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Table** | `highcost_alerts` |
| **Monitor** | `rolling_spend_30d` |
| **Condition** | `rolling_spend_30d > 50000` |
| **Action 1** | **Email** → notify case manager |
| **Action 2** | **Power Automate** → trigger care management workflow (optional) |
| **Card fields** | patient_id, rolling_spend_30d, ed_visits_30d, cost_trend, risk_tier |
| **Email Subject** | `💰 High-Cost Alert — Patient {{patient_id}}: ${{rolling_spend_30d}} in 30d` |
| **Email Body** | `ED Visits: {{ed_visits_30d}}, Trend: {{cost_trend}}, Tier: {{risk_tier}}` |

#### Step 4: Verify Alerts Fire

1. Run **NB_RTI_Event_Simulator** in batch mode to generate test events
2. Run the 3 scoring notebooks (Fraud, Care Gap, HighCost)
3. Check your Teams channel / email for alert cards within ~60 seconds

> **Power Automate integration**: For complex routing (create ServiceNow tickets, update EHR systems, page on-call staff), select **Power Automate** as the action and build a flow that reads the alert payload. The Reflex trigger passes all card fields as dynamic content to the flow.

**Rule 4 — 30-Day Readmission (Care Transitions Alert)**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Table** | `readmission_events` |
| **Monitor** | `readmission_risk_score` |
| **Condition** | `readmission_risk_score >= 70 OR (days_since_discharge <= 7 AND readmission_risk_score >= 50)` |
| **Action 1** | **Teams** → post to `#care-transitions` channel |
| **Action 2** | **Power Automate** → create Care Transitions task in EHR (optional) |
| **Card fields** | patient_id, facility_id, days_since_discharge, drg_code, current_diagnosis, prior_diagnosis, readmission_risk_score |
| **Email Subject** | `🔁 Readmission Alert — Patient {{patient_id}}: {{days_since_discharge}}d since discharge` |
| **Email Body** | `Risk {{readmission_risk_score}}/100, DRG {{drg_code}}, Prior dx: {{prior_diagnosis}}, Current dx: {{current_diagnosis}}` |

#### Pre-Demo Health Check

Before any executive demo, run the verification script to confirm streaming, scoring, and patient ID overlap are all healthy:

```powershell
cd Payer-Provider-Phase-2-Ongoing-main\scripts
$env:KUSTO_QUERY_URI = "https://<your-eventhouse>.z9.kusto.fabric.microsoft.com"
$env:KQL_DATABASE = "Healthcare_RTI_DB"
python verify_demo_ready.py
```

The script runs 8 checks (input freshness, scoring freshness, threshold coverage, readmission landing, ADT enum, patient ID overlap). Exits non-zero on any FAIL. **Do not present if any check fails.** See [scripts/verify_demo_ready.py](scripts/verify_demo_ready.py).

#### Real-World Pain Points Solved

| Pain Point | How Activator Solves It |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Fraud goes undetected for days** | Fraud scores ≥ 50 trigger immediate SIU email — MTTD drops from days to minutes |
| **Care gaps missed during admissions** | Patients with overdue HEDIS measures are flagged on admission — care coordinators act while the patient is still in-house |
| **High-cost members escalate silently** | Spending trajectories > $50K/30d trigger proactive case management before costs spiral |
| **30-day readmissions detected after-the-fact** | `readmission_events` fires within minutes of a re-admit ADT — care transitions team gets a Teams alert with prior DRG and discharge date |
| **Alert fatigue from noisy dashboards** | Activator fires only when thresholds breach — no polling, no dashboards to watch |
| **Ops teams lack unified triage** | Combined with the Operations Agent, alerts from all 4 streams (fraud, care gaps, high-cost, readmissions) flow into a single prioritized view |
| **Compliance audit trail gaps** | Every Activator trigger is logged with timestamp, threshold, and action taken — ready for audit |

### Run Incremental Loads

After the initial full load, you can simulate daily operational data arriving. The pipeline supports a `load_mode` parameter that switches between full rebuild and incremental processing.

#### How It Works

The **PL_Healthcare_Master** pipeline accepts a `load_mode` parameter (default `"full"`). When set to `"incremental"`, the pipeline:

1. **Generates new data** — runs `NB_Generate_Incremental_Data` to create today's records
2. **Bronze: APPEND** — new CSVs are appended to existing Bronze tables (not overwritten), then archived to `Files/processed/` to prevent duplicate reads
3. **Silver: Full rebuild** — Silver notebooks always read all Bronze data, clean, deduplicate, and overwrite Silver tables (idempotent)
4. **Gold: MERGE** — Gold uses Delta Lake merge operations:
   - **SCD Type 2 dimensions** (`dim_patient`, `dim_provider`): detects attribute changes (city, state, zip, specialty, department), expires old versions (`is_current=0`), and inserts new versions with new surrogate keys
   - **Type 1 dimensions** (`dim_payer`, `dim_facility`, `dim_diagnosis`, `dim_medication`): overwritten (reference data, no history needed)
   - **Fact tables** (`fact_encounter`, `fact_claim`, `fact_prescription`): Delta MERGE on business key — updates existing rows, inserts new ones

#### Data Volumes Per Incremental Run

| Entity | New Rows | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Encounters | ~50 | All dated today |
| Claims | ~50 | One per encounter |
| Diagnoses | ~100–150 | 1 principal + 0–2 secondary per encounter |
| Prescriptions | ~75–100 | 1–3 per encounter based on diagnosis |
| Patients | ~2 new + 2–3 updates | Updates simulate address/insurance changes |

#### Steps

**Option A — Run from the Pipeline UI:**

1. Open **PL_Healthcare_Master** in your Fabric workspace
2. Click **Run** → set parameter `load_mode` = `incremental`
3. Wait ~10–12 minutes for the pipeline to complete

**Option B — Run the notebooks manually:**

1. Open **NB_Generate_Incremental_Data** → Run All  
   *(writes timestamped CSVs to `Files/incremental/YYYY-MM-DD/`)*
2. Open **PL_Healthcare_Full_Load** → Run with parameter `load_mode=incremental`  
   *(or run Bronze → Silver → Gold notebooks individually)*

#### Scheduling

To automate daily incremental loads, add a **Schedule trigger** to `PL_Healthcare_Master`:

1. Open the pipeline → **Schedule** (top toolbar)  
2. Set recurrence (e.g., daily at 6:00 AM)  
3. Add parameter: `load_mode` = `incremental`

#### Verifying Incremental Data

After an incremental run, check that new data flowed through:

```sql
-- Gold layer: count should increase by ~50 per run
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lh_gold_curated.fact_encounter

-- SCD2: check for expired patient versions
SELECT patient_id, city, is_current, effective_end_date
FROM lh_gold_curated.dim_patient
WHERE is_current = 0
ORDER BY effective_end_date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Repeat daily to build up a realistic data history showing trends over time in the Power BI dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Workspace is not empty" | Create a new empty workspace, or set `allow_non_empty_workspace=True` in the config cell |
| Pipeline fails | Open PL_Healthcare_Master → check activity run details. Common cause: lakehouse tables not yet created |
| Semantic model shows no data | Run the pipeline first — it populates Gold lakehouse tables that the model reads |
| Data Agent returns generic answers | Ensure `healthcare_knowledge/` docs were uploaded to `lh_gold_curated/Files/` |
| Graph Agent shows no results | Ensure ontology is deployed (Cell 10a) and graph is populated. Run Cell 10b to patch graph agent IDs |
| Ontology not auto-deployed | Cell 10a deploys the ontology + graph via API. Re-run the cell or check logs for errors |
| Data Agent returns generic answers | Open the agent → verify AI instructions are pasted from [DATA_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md § 1a](DATA_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md#1a--ai-instructions-stage_configjson) and data source is connected |
| `fabric-launcher` install fails | Ensure your Fabric capacity supports Python package installation |
