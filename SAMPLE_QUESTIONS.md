## Provider Agent — CMO Executive Summary (Phase 2)

These questions exercise the new CMO fewshots added to **ProviderAgent**:

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| C1 | What should I be worried about today as CMO? |
| C2 | CMO executive summary: what's our readmission rate this month vs the 15% benchmark and how many high-risk patients haven't been readmitted yet? |
| C3 | What's driving readmissions — which chronic conditions? |
| C4 | Show me intervention candidates: high-risk readmission patients who are also medication non-adherent. |
| C5 | How does SDOH risk tier affect our readmission rate? Are we delivering equitable care? |
| C6 | Which providers should I peer-review this week — high denial rate or low documentation score? |

## Graph Agent (Healthcare Ontology Agent)

Open **Healthcare Ontology Agent** in your Fabric workspace. This agent navigates the Healthcare_Demo_Ontology_HLS graph — tracing relationships between providers, payers, claims, encounters, and patients. Unlike HealthcareHLSAgent (which does SQL aggregations), the Graph Agent excels at **entity profiles**, **relationship traversal**, and **network exploration**.

> **When to use which agent:**
> - **HealthcareHLSAgent** → "How many?", "What rate?", "Top 10", "Monthly trend" (aggregations)
> - **Healthcare Ontology Agent** → "Show me this provider's network", "Which payers denied these claims?", "Trace this claim end-to-end" (traversals)

> **Performance tip:** For "full profile" questions (e.g., Q1 below), the agent runs **separate queries** per relationship type (encounters, claims, prescriptions) rather than one giant query. This avoids Cartesian products that would create millions of intermediate rows and hang. Always specify a provider_id, name, or specialty to help the agent filter early.

### Provider Operations & Network
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Show me a full provider profile — patients treated, encounters, claims submitted, and prescriptions written. (You can specify a provider_id, name, or specialty — or let the agent pick one.) |
| 2 | Which providers have submitted claims that were denied? Show each provider with their denied claims, denial reasons, payers, and patients. |
| 3 | Pick a provider and show me their patient panel — encounters, diagnoses, and outcomes for their patients. |
| 4 | Show me prescribing patterns for providers in a given specialty — what medications, which patients, and which payers cover the prescriptions? (Try Cardiology, Internal Medicine, etc.) |
| 5 | Which providers treat patients with high readmission risk? Show the provider, their high-risk patients, and conditions. |
| 6 | Which providers serve patients in socially vulnerable communities? Show the SDOH profile alongside provider details. |

### Payer Portfolio & Coverage
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 7 | Show me all claims for a specific payer — which providers submitted them, which patients, and what were the outcomes? (Name any payer or let the agent list them.) |
| 8 | Which payers have the most denied claims? For each payer show the denials with provider, patient, encounter, and denial reason. |
| 9 | What prescriptions does each payer cover? Show the medication, prescribing provider, and patient. |
| 10 | Show me the provider network that bills a specific payer — which providers submit claims and for what encounter types? |
| 11 | Which payers cover patients in high SDOH risk areas? Show the payer, the patients, and their social risk factors. |

### Claims & Financial Investigation
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 12 | Trace a claim end-to-end — from patient through encounter, provider, and payer. (Provide a claim_id or say "pick a denied claim".) |
| 13 | Show me all denied claims with the complete story — which provider submitted, to which payer, for which patient, and why denied. |
| 14 | What claims are linked to a specific encounter? Show the financial picture including payer and provider. |
| 15 | Show me denied claims for high-risk readmission patients — which providers and payers are involved. |
| 16 | Show me high-cost encounters — who was the provider, what diagnoses, what payer, and was the claim denied. |

### Provider-Payer Network Analysis
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 17 | How are providers and payers connected through claims? Show me the provider-payer claims network. |
| 18 | Which chronic medications are prescribed across the provider network and which payers reimburse them. |
| 19 | Show me the relationship between claim denials and patient diagnoses — what conditions are associated with denied claims. |
| 20 | Trace prescription costs by payer — which payers bear the highest prescription burden and for what drug classes. |

### Clinical Operations & Interventions
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 21 | Show me patients with poor medication adherence — who are their providers and which payers cover them? These are intervention opportunities. |
| 22 | Show me which payers cover prescriptions for each drug class — break down total cost, payer-paid, and patient copay. |
| 23 | Find our most vulnerable population — patients in high SDOH risk areas who are non-adherent with high readmission risk. Show providers and payers involved. |
| 24 | What is the overall denial rate by payer or the average cost per provider across the network? |

### Prescription-Payer Relationship Traversal
| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 25 | For a specific patient, trace all their prescriptions — which provider prescribed each, which payer covers it, and what's the patient copay? |
| 26 | Which payers cover the highest-cost specialty medications? Show the drug, prescribing provider, and payer for the top 20 most expensive prescriptions. |
| 27 | Show me the full prescription lifecycle for a chronic medication — from prescribing provider to payer reimbursement to patient out-of-pocket cost. |
| 28 | Which providers prescribe the most non-generic medications and which payers are absorbing that cost? |
| 29 | For patients in food desert zip codes, trace their prescriptions — are payers covering their chronic medications adequately or are copays high? |

> **Note:** Question 24 involves aggregation — the graph agent will explain that rates/rankings require HealthcareHLSAgent and offer to explore specific payers or providers instead. This demonstrates the agent's ability to redirect to the right tool.
